# Micro-Tools
Collection of small tools. (Written in various languages)

## Description
### Arguments-Grabber (C++ | win-64)
Arguments that are passed to this program will be copied to the clipboard.  This program was originally created to grab magnet links from a web browser when copying was not an option.

### Duplication-Checker (PowerShell & Python)
Scans directories for duplicate files.  Two scripts are included to allow duplication checking based on either filename or MD5-hash.  The scripts do **not** delete duplicate files and instead, saves the list to a TXT or CSV.
